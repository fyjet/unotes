# JLINK Adapter specification
Interface definition from [SEGGER website](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/interface-description/)

![Pinout](/unotes/assets/img/SEGGER_JTAG_2x10.svg)
J-Link has a JTAG connector compatible to ARM's Multi-ICE

Pin	| Signal | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | --------
1 | VTref | Input | This is the target reference voltage. It is used to check if the target has power, to create the logic-level reference for the input comparators and to control the output logic levels to the target. It is normally fed from Vdd of the target board and must not have a series resistor. 
2 | Not connected | NC | This pin is not connected in J-Link. It is reserved for compatibility with other equipment. Connect to Vdd or leave open in target system.
3 | nTRST | Output | JTAG Reset. Output from J-Link to the Reset signal of the target JTAG port. Typically connected to nTRST of the target CPU. This pin is normally pulled HIGH on the target to avoid unintentional resets when there is no connection.
5 | TDI | Output | JTAG data input of target CPU. It is recommended that this pin is pulled to a defined state on the target board. Typically connected to TDI of target CPU.
7 | TMS | Output | JTAG mode set input of target CPU. This pin should be pulled up on the target. Typically connected to TMS of target CPU.
9 | TCK | Output | JTAG clock signal to target CPU. It is recommended that this pin is pulled to a defined state of the target board. Typically connected to TCK of target CPU.
11 | RTCK | Input | Return test clock signal from the target. Some targets must synchronize the JTAG inputs to internal clocks. To assist in meeting this requirement, you can use a returned, and retimed, TCK to dynamically control the TCK rate. J-Link supports adaptive clocking, which waits for TCK changes to be echoed correctly before making further changes. Connect to RTCK if available, otherwise to GND.
13 | TDO | Input | JTAG data output from target CPU. Typically connected to TDO of target CPU.
15 | nRESET | I/O | Target CPU reset signal. Typically connected to the RESET pin of the target CPU, which is typically called "nRST", "nRESET" or "RESET". This signal is an active low signal.
17 | DBGRQ | NC | This pin is not connected inside J-Link.It is reserved for compatibility with other equipment to be used as a debug request signal to the target system. Typically connected to DBGRQ if available, otherwise left open.
19 | 5V-Supply | Output | This pin can be used to supply power to the target hardware.

Notes

All pins marked NC are not connected inside J-Link. Any signal can be applied here; J-Link will simply ignore such a signal. Pins 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 are GND pins connected to GND in J-Link. They should also be connected to GND in the target system.

Pin 2 is not connected inside J-Link. A lot of targets have pin 1 and pin 2 connected. Some targets use pin 2 instead of pin 1 to supply VCC. These targets will not work with J-Link, unless Pin 1 and Pin 2 are connected on the target's JTAG connector.

Pin 3 (TRST) should be connected to target CPUs TRST pin (sometimes called NTRST). J-Link will also work if this pin is not connected, but you may experience some limitations when debugging. TRST should be separate from the CPU Reset (pin 15)

Pin 11 (RTCK) should be connected to RTCK if available, otherwise to GND.

Pin 19 (5V-Target supply) of the connector can be used to supply power to the target hardware. Supply voltage is 5V, max. current is 300mA. The output current is monitored and protected against overload and short-circuit.

# JTAG on esp32
The minimal signalling to get a working JTAG connection are TDI, TDO, TCK, TMS and GND

Tutorial:

using VSCode

ESP32 pin | JTAG probe pin
-- | --:
3.3V | Pin 1(VTref)
GPIO 9 (EN) | Pin 3 (nTRST)
GND | Pin 4 (GND)
GPIO 12 (TDI) |	Pin 5 (TDI)
GPIO 14 (TMS) |	Pin 7 (TMS)
GPIO 13 (TCK) |	Pin 9 (TCK)
GPIO 15 (TDO) |	Pin 13 (TDO)

Configure platformio.ini to set JLink to upload:

[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
debug_tool = jlink
upload_protocol = jlink
framework = arduino

Add break points in source code, then go to Debug menu, then Strart Debugging.

Wait a minutes, time to setup debug session.
